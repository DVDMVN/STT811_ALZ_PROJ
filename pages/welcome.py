    This dashboard presents an interactive exploration of a global Alzheimer's prediction dataset sourced from Kaggle.
    Our goal is to uncover key risk factors for Alzheimer's diagnosis using data-driven analysis and machine learning techniques.

    Contents: This application is based on a single, rich dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, and genetic information from individuals across various countries.
    - The dashboard is organized across three pages:
        - **About the Data**
            - Initial Data Analysis (IDA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
            - Handling of missing values and outliers
            - Feature encoding and other preprocessing techniques
            - Visualization and analysis of feature distributions and correlations
        - **Modeling**: Evaluation of different machine learning models, including feature importance and interaction analysis.
            - Performance of multiple ML models on Alzheimer's diagnosis prediction
            - Analysis of top contributing features
            - Exploration of interaction effects and their impact on model performance
        - **Documentation**: Technical appendix covering feature details and references for sources.
