# STT811 Alzheimer's Dataset Exploration Disease Prediction

Files:

`data`
- Folder holding our dataset(s).

`download_dataset.ipynb`
- Some code to download the dataset using the python kaggle API. Since the data is small enough, the data can be uploaded to GitHub without replication issue, so this notebook may not be used.

`exploration_notebook.ipynb`
- Notebook for exploration of the data in an interactive manner. Later, we may port information and functions used in this notebook toward .py file structure application.

`requirements.txt`
- Lightweight environment dependencies file.

`util.py`
- Global helper functions. May be refactored later to be more specified.
